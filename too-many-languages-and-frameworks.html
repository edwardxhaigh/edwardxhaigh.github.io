				<h3>Too many languages and frameworks</h3>

				<p>I am new to programming, and as new programmers often do, I spend a lot of time looking at different programming languages and frameworks instead of actually learning them. I have a stack of text books next to me ranging from C++ to HTML, Design Interfaces to Unity programming. I've studied Python, looking at Flask, Django, Watson APIs for Machine Learning, pygame and so much more. Then the next month I will be reading about C++ and pointers, instantly forgetting how Python works and then realising I'm practising my 'CSS Art'. It's incredibly frustrating. I understand I can't learn everything but that does not seem to have stopped me trying.</p>
				<p>My plan of going Freelance during Autumn is forever becoming less likely as I spend another day studying an unemployable skill, or changing directions every other hour. John, the owner of Simple Programmer, says that as long as you're moving forward then you are progressing no matter how many times you turn the steering wheel. However I feel that by progressing in so many areas inevitably I will come back to an area three months later and have to relearn it, so I assume that his analogy does not expect one to drive in circles. Moving forward does not help if you don't go anywhere in the end!</p>
				<p>The way I am going to get out of this circular trip is simple, I need to make myself pick a direction and keep going towards a set destination. I am not sure if this will be learning front-end development, Python, or even C++. I think the only way to progress will be to pick one however and only look at that for the rest of the year at least. No distractions. I can already see myself failing!</p>
				<p>Now my next issue is picking which one of these skill sets I try to develop. I guess I could write them down on paper and pick one out of a hat. I can't choose based on what I want to develop or create - I love the idea of making everything from a web application to a high performance quant program.</p>
				<p>Normally I would spend time deliberating on this. However, in a bid to change myself for the better, I will decide on specialising in Front-End development. I believe it will be the easiest to find work in, it appears to be the easier to learn, I can get an immediate visual response to my code - it seems like a good starting point. On top of this the learning resources are better, there are sites like Udacity and Free Code Camp. Finally, I can always use Python to serve these files so I can still play about with other languages, though I must resist doing this for at least a couple months for fear of returning to this point in my career again!</p>
				<p>As I continue to progress with my journey of becoming a full time developer (employed or freelance, I am not yet sure), I will endeavor to update this blog space. Hopefully, if you too face one of my challenges, then my thought process may help you overcome said challenge, even if you don't choose the route I do. Again as John said - I have to just keep driving forward, I just need to make sure that I don't turn the steering wheel for a while.</p>
